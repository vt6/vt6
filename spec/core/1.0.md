# `vt6/core1.0` - Fundamental protocols and interface contracts

The canonical URL for this document is <https://vt6.io/std/core/1.0/>.

**This is a non-normative draft.**

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

This document uses augmented Backus-Naur form (ABNF) as defined in [RFC 5234](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5234).

Unless stated otherwise, this document implies all definitions of terms made by [`vt6/foundation`](https://vt6.io/std/foundation/).

## 1. Scope

This module contains the most basic parts of the VT6 protocol that can be versioned.
The only thing more basic than this is [`vt6/foundation`](https://vt6.io/std/foundation/) which contains the unversionable parts of the VT6 protocol.
Except for [`vt6/term`](https://vt6.io/std/term/) and platform integration modules, `vt6/core` is the only module which we expect every VT6 application to support.

## 2. Definitions

### 2.1. Predefined property types

When a property is said to **accept string values**, this means that the set of acceptable values for this property is the set of all byte strings whose value is a properly UTF-8-encoded string.

*Rationale:* [utf8everywhere.org](http://utf8everywhere.org) nicely sums up the arguments for not bothering with other text encodings.

```abnf
integer          = "0" / ( [sign] nzdigit *digit )
unsigned-integer = "0" / ( nzdigit *digit )

sign = "+" / "-"
```

When a property is said to **accept integer values**, this means that the set of acceptable values for this property is the set of all byte strings whose value matches the `<integer>` grammar element defined above.
Analogously, when a property is said to **accept unsigned integer values**, this means that the set of acceptable values for this property is the set of all byte strings whose value matches the `<unsigned-integer>` grammar element defined above.

In both these cases, the **numerical value** of each such byte string is the decimal value of the sequence of digits in the byte string's value, possibly negated by a sign.
The module specification defining the property may impose additional restrictions on the numerical value of the property.

```abnf
; cannot use string literals here (boolean = "f" / "t")
; because those are case-insensitive in ABNF
boolean = %x66 / %x74
```

When a property is said to **accept boolean values**, this means that the set of acceptable values for this property are the two single-byte strings `f` and `t`.
The **logical value** of the property SHALL be "false" for the byte string `f` and "true" for the byte string `t`.

Module specifications which use some or all of the property types defined in this section SHALL reference this section.
The recommended way to do so is by including the following sentence near the start of the specification:

> This document uses the predefined property types from `vt6/core1.0`.

## 3. Message types for `vt6/core1.0`

### 3.1. The `core1.client-make` message

```vt6
(core1.client-make <client-id> <stdin-screen-id> <stdout-screen-id> <stderr-screen-id>)
```

- Role: request (answered by `core1.client-new`)
- Number of arguments: four

A client sends a `core1.client-make` message to inform the terminal about a client ID that it has chosen.
Note that, as described in `vt6/foundation`, sect. 2.6, the client ID can also refer to a lifetime within the current client, instead of a new client started by that client.

The first argument of the message SHALL be a client ID.
The second through fourth argument of the message SHALL be a screen ID, as defined in `vt6/term1.0`, or an empty byte string.
The message is semantically invalid if any of the last three arguments contain a screen ID that is not known to the terminal.

If the second argument is not empty, it indicates that the standard input of the client with the given client ID is going to be connected directly to the screen identified by that screen ID.
The third argument describes the client's standard output, respectively.
The fourth argument describes the client's standard error, respectively.

*Rationale:* The terminal needs to be made aware of these relationships because being connected to a screen permits the respective client to change properties of this screen, create additional screens inside that screen, and so on.

### 3.2. The `core1.client-new` message

```vt6
(core1.client-new <client-secret>)
```

- Role: response (answers `core1.client-make`)
- Number of arguments: one

Upon receiving a valid `core1.client-make` message, a terminal SHALL record that client in its bookkeeping and reply with a `core1.client-new` message.

```abnf
ascii-glyph = %x21-7E
secret-token = *32ascii-glyph
```

The only argument of the message SHALL be a secret, as accepted by the `<secret-token>` grammar element defined above.
The secret SHALL be unique and SHOULD be randomly generated.
The secret can then be used by the client in a platform-specific way to obtain a message stream with the client ID as specified in the original `core1.client-make` request.

### 3.3. The `core1.client-end` message

```vt6
(core1.client-end <client-id>)
```

- Role: request (not answered)
- Number of arguments: one

A client sends a `core1.client-end` message to its terminal to announce the end of the lifetime of a client ID.

The only argument of the message SHALL be a client ID.
The message is semantically invalid if the client ID of the message stream over which the message is sent does not include that client ID.
The message is not semantically invalid if the terminal does not know about any client with that client ID, as long as it knows about at least one client ID that is included in it.

Upon receiving a `core1.client-end` message, the terminal SHALL consider the lifetime of that client ID ended, as defined in `vt6/foundation`, sect. 2.6.
A response SHALL NOT be sent.

### 3.4. The `core1.sub` message

```vt6
(core1.sub <property-name>)
```

- Role: request (answered by `core1.pub`, delayed responses possible)
- Number of arguments: one

A client sends a `core1.sub` message to establish a **subscription** to a property.
The argument SHALL be the name of that property.
The message is semantically invalid if its argument is not the name of a property.

Upon receiving a valid `core1.sub` message, the terminal MUST record a subscription to the specified property, and immediately notify the sender of the property's current value with a corresponding `core1.pub` response (see below).
Further `core1.pub` responses SHALL be generated whenever the property's value changes.

*Rationale:* It is intentional that subscribing to a property is the only way to retrieve a property's value.
This design nudges implementors towards handling changes to properties properly.

### 3.5. The `core1.pub` message

```vt6
(core1.pub <property-name> <property-value>)
```

- Role: response (answers `core1.sub` and `core1.set`)
- Number of arguments: two

A terminal sends a `core1.pub` message in response to a `core1.sub` or `core1.set` message.
The first argument SHALL be the name of a property.
The second argument SHALL be the value of that property.

The message is semantically invalid if:

- its first argument is not the name of a property, or
- its second argument is not a valid value for the property in question according to the specification defining the property.

### 3.6. The `core1.set` message

```vt6
(core1.set <property-name> <property-value>)
```

- Role: request (answered by `core1.pub`, delayed responses possible)
- Number of arguments: two

A client can send a `core1.set` message to the terminal to request that the value of a property be changed.
The argument list of a `core1.set` message has the same form as that of a `core1.pub` message (a pair of property name and value).

The message is semantically invalid if:

- its first argument is not the name of a property, or
- its second argument is a value that is not permissible for the property in question.

*Rationale:* For non-trivial properties, the client might not have enough information to decide whether a given value is valid.
In that case, the client can check for a `nope` response to check the validity of the value.

A client's request to change the value of a property does not imply any obligation of the terminal to comply with this request.
The terminal may refuse to change the property's value at all (especially if the property is read-only), it may comply with the request, or set the property to an entirely different value, as long as the value is valid according to the property's specification.

Upon receiving a valid `core1.set` message, the terminal MUST record a subscription for the specified property in the same way as if a `core1.sub` message was received for the same property.
The terminal MUST reply with a `core1.pub` message to indicate the new value of the property, regardless of whether the value was changed or not.
The client SHOULD observe the initial response to learn whether the requested changes were accepted.
Further `core1.pub` responses SHALL be generated whenever the property's value changes.
