# `vt6/mux1.0` - Multiplexing clients onto a single bidirectional connection

This document specifies version `1.0` of the VT6 module `mux`.
Refer to this document using the identifier `vt6/mux1.0` or its canonical URL <https://vt6.io/std/mux/1.0/>.

**This is a non-normative draft.**

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).
This document uses the predefined property types from section 3.4 of the `vt6/core1.0` specification.

## 1. Scope

When a VT6 server on a remote machine than its clients, only a single bidirectional connection to the server (such as an SSH connection) may be available that all clients must share.
If that is the case, a VT6 proxy may be used to multiplex the inputs and outputs of all clients onto the single line to the server.
We shall refer to this proxy process as the **muxer**.

The muxer acts as a server to the clients, thus allowing the clients to run in normal mode, and as a client in multiplexed mode to the original server.
This module provides messages that can be exchanged between server and muxer to facilitate the multiplexing of the clients' messages and input/output data onto the connection between server and muxer.

*Note:* Refer to the `vt6/core` module specification for the definitions of the terms "VT6 server", "VT6 client", "VT6 proxy", "normal mode" and "multiplexed mode".
