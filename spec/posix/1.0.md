# `vt6/posix1.0` - Platform integration on POSIX-compliant systems

This document specifies version `1.0` of the VT6 module `posix`.
Refer to this document using the identifier `vt6/posix1.0` or its canonical URL <https://vt6.io/std/posix/1.0/>.

**This is a non-normative draft.**

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

## 1. Scope

Operating systems that implement the [POSIX.1 specification](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/) are admissible environments for VT6 clients and servers.
This module defines how various platform-specific mechanisms throughout VT6 work on such operating systems.

## 2. Definitions for the `vt6/core1.0` module

Standard input and output for each VT6 client are the file descriptors 0 and 1 of that process, respectively.

POSIX allows processes to be started while a VT6 server is not present.
Therefore, VT6 clients MUST use the following method to determine whether a VT6 server is present.

1. If the `VT6` environment variable is present, its content is the absolute path to a socket file.
   In this case, the VT6 client SHALL assume that a VT6 server is present, and operate in normal mode.
   To obtain a server connection, the VT6 client SHALL connect to this socket file with socket type `SOCK_SEQPACKET`, and upon success, use the open socket as a server connection.
   When the connection to the socket fails, the VT6 client MAY either bail out, or continue to operate as if no VT6 server is present.

2. If the `TERM` environment variable is present and contains the string `vt6`, the VT6 client SHALL assume that a VT6 server is present, and operate in multiplexed mode.

3. If the `VT6` environment variable is absent and the `TERM` environment variable does not contain the string `vt6`, the VT6 client MUST consider the VT6 server to be absent.

## 3. Definitions for the `vt6/sig1.0` module

VT6 signals are dispatched to clients by sending the corresponding POSIX signals to the client processes:

- The `sig.interrupt` message corresponds to the `SIGINT` signal.
- The `sig.quit` message corresponds to the `SIGQUIT` signal.
- The `sig.suspend` message corresponds to the `SIGSTOP` signal.

When there is no signal dispatcher, the terminal SHOULD run all clients inside a single process group, and send these POSIX signals to that process group.

When there is a signal dispatcher, the signal dispatcher SHALL use at least one process group in the same way.
If the signal dispatcher can distinguish between client processes running in the foreground or in the background, it SHOULD use multiple process groups to track which processes are running in the foreground and send the POSIX signals to the current foreground process group only.

When a server or signal dispatcher uses the `SIGSTOP` signal to suspend processes, the `SIGCONT` signal SHALL be used to resume these processes once the user instructs the server or signal dispatcher to do so.
