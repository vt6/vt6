# `vt6/term1.0` - Universal terminal capabilities and input/output handling

The canonical URL for this document is <https://vt6.io/std/term/1.0/>.

**This is a non-normative draft.**

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

This document uses the predefined property types from [section 2.4 of `vt6/core1.0`](https://vt6.io/std/core/1.0/#section-2-4).

## 1. Scope

This module defines how a terminal works, how clients' standard output is reflected on the terminal, and how user input is presented on clients' standard input.
Besides [`vt6/core`](https://vt6.io/std/core/), this is the only module that we expect to be available in **every** VT6 server implementation across the entire feature spectrum, from graphical terminal emulators all the way down to continuous stationery printers.

This document uses the definitions introduced in [section 1 of `vt6/core1.0`](https://vt6.io/std/core/1.0/#section-1).

TODO review wording of entire document when the PR with the core.to-stdio message lands

### 1.1. Terminals

A **Unicode document** is a string of Unicode characters with a cursor.
The cursor points either at the start of the string (before the first character), at its end (after the last character) or between two adjacent characters.

When a VT6 server agrees to using this module, it MUST have a Unicode document (the **terminal document**) that its clients can interact with as described in section 1.2.
All clients MUST act upon the same terminal document.

If the server takes text input from a user or some other source, it MAY pass this input to the clients as described in section 1.3.

*Rationale:* This is a "MAY" because some servers (e.g. continuous stationery printers) do not have an input method, and because not all text input into a terminal application is intended to be standard input (e.g. input into a terminal's settings window).

The terminal document and its cursor SHOULD NOT be manipulated by the server in any way except for those ways specifically permitted in this specification and in the specifications for other VT6 module versions which the server has agreed to using.

*Rationale:* Clients should be able to rely on the server interpreting their standard output faithfully.

### 1.2. Standard output

When the server receives a byte string written by a client into its standard output, the server SHALL assume that this byte string is encoded in [UTF-8](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3629), and decode it into a string of Unicode characters.
Invalid byte sequences or invalid code points SHALL be handled gracefully, for instance, by replacing them with the replacement character (U+FFFD).

When the `term.output-protected` property is true, the server MUST then discard all active characters from this string.
**Active characters**, for the purpose of this specification, are all characters that are in the general categories Cc ("Other, control"), Cf ("Other, format"), Cs ("Other, surrogate"), Co ("Other, private use") and Cn ("Other, not assigned"), except for U+0009 (Horizontal Tab), U+000A (New Line), U+000C (Form Feed) and U+000D (Carriage Return).
When the active character to be discarded is U+001B (Escape), the server MUST also discard characters directly succeeding it as follows:

- When the next character after U+001B is from the range U+0040-U+005F, that character is also discarded.
- When the character discarded in the previous step was U+005B (the opening bracket `[`), then any succeeding characters that are in the range U+0020-U+003F are also discarded, up until a character from the range U+0040-U+007F is encountered, which is also discarded. If any unexpected characters are found while searching for characters to discard, the server MAY choose to not discard anything except for the initial U+001B character.

*Rationale:* That's how ANSI escape sequences are structured.

When the `term.output-protected` property is false, the server MAY alternatively:

- choose a printable representation for each active character and replace the character with that representation before continuing, or
- interpret the control sequence started by that active character if the character is U+001B (Escape).

When a control character is interpreted as starting a control sequence, the entire control sequence SHALL be removed from the string before processing as described in this section continues, and the remaining string or the server's internal state MAY be modified depending on the semantics of the control sequence.

*Rationale:* This rule allows terminals to be backwards-compatible with legacy control sequences, such as those defined in VT100 aka ECMA-48 aka ANSI X3.64 aka ISO/IEC 6429.

Characters that are in the general category Co ("Other, private use") MAY be exempted from the treatment described above if the characters in question have a graphic representation in the font that the terminal uses to display its character array.

Finally, the server MUST discard each U+000A (new line) character that immediately succeeds a U+000D (carriage return) character, and then convert each U+000D character into a U+000A character.

*Rationale:* This rule ensures consistent line break handling across different platforms, i.e., CR+NL = CR = NL.

The remaining string of Unicode characters SHALL then be inserted into the terminal document at the position pointed to by the cursor.
The cursor SHALL be updated to point at the position directly after the inserted string.

If the terminal document would grow too large to fit within the program's memory because of this operation, the server MAY choose to discard some of the text at the start of the document.
If it does so, it SHOULD discard entire lines or paragraphs, that is, the last codepoint discarded SHOULD be U+000A, U+000C, U+2028 or U+2029.
If the cursor points to the start of or into the discarded portion of the terminal document, it SHALL be moved to its end before the discarding.

*Rationale:* Chomping off only parts of a line causes unnecessary confusion on the side of the user.

### 1.3. Standard input

TODO describe how keypresses are reflected on stdin (canonical/raw mode, noecho property, allow ANSI escape sequences for control keys, etc.), how Ctrl-D is handled

### 1.4. Display

If the server displays the document to a user, or renders it to some graphics device or file, then the terminal document SHALL be laid out according to the rules for normalization, writing direction, line breaking and handling of bidirectional text as defined in the Unicode Standard, as published by the [Unicode consortium](https://www.unicode.org).

The surface onto which the terminal document is rendered is called the **terminal viewport**.

## 2. Properties for `vt6/term1`

Several of the properties defined below are **connection-lifetime-scoped**.
When a property is defined to be connection-lifetime-scoped, its value MUST be determined as follows:

- If there is at least one open server connection where the property's value has been set with a `core.set` message, the value of the property is the value requested by the corresponding client in that `core.set` message which has been received most recently by the server.
- Otherwise, the value of the property is the **initial value** for that property, as defined by its specification.

This especially means that:

- The value of the property may implicitly change whenever a server connection which has set the property value is closed.
- All client requests to set the property value (using a `core.set` message) MUST be honored by the server. The new value of the property MUST be identical to the value requested by the client.

### 2.1. The `term.width` property

- Acceptable values: unsigned integers
- Can be set by client: no

The value of this property is the maximum number of printable ASCII characters (Unicode codepoints U+0020-U+007F) that can be displayed on the terminal viewport without having to break the line or overflow the viewport.

It MAY be computed as follows:

1. For any printable ASCII codepoint `c`, let `N(c)` be the maximum length of a string containing only the codepoint `c`, such that a rendering of this string fits in the width of the terminal viewport without line breaks or overflows.
2. The value of the `term.width` property is `N(c')` where `c'` is that value of `c` that minimizes `N(c)`.

*Rationale:* This is a "MAY" because servers may employ more sophisticated computations to account for ligatures, or simpler computations if they use monospace fonts.

The value of this property SHALL NOT be zero.
If the computation above would result in a value of zero, the server SHALL report a value of one instead.

*Rationale:* To avoid divide-by-zero bugs in client code.

TODO move to vt6/mono, simplify accordingly

### 2.2. The `term.viewport-height` property

- Acceptable values: unsigned integers
- Can be set by client: no

The value of this property is the maximum number of lines that can be visible at once on the terminal viewport.
A value of zero indicates that the viewport is infinitely tall.

*Rationale:* Continuous stationery printers are a practical example of vertically unbounded viewports.

TODO move to vt6/mono, simplify accordingly

### 2.3. The `term.input-immediate` property

- Acceptable values: booleans
- Can be set by clients: yes

This property is connection-lifetime-scoped, as defined above.
The initial value is false.

A value of true indicates that the server MUST make all input available to clients immediately, regardless of how many or which characters have been received.

A value of false indicates that the server MAY buffer input and only make it available to clients once a certain condition has been met (most commonly, when an entire line of input has been received).

### 2.4. The `term.input-echo` property

- Acceptable values: booleans
- Can be set by clients: yes

This property is connection-lifetime-scoped, as defined above.
The initial value is true.

When the value of this property is true, all input that is made available to a client is also added to the terminal document as if its UTF-8-encoded form had been received by the server from a client's standard output.

### 2.5. The `term.output-protected` property

- Acceptable values: booleans
- Can be set by clients: yes

This property is connection-lifetime-scoped, as defined above.
The initial value is false.

The semantics of this property are defined in section 1.2.

### 2.6. The `term.output-reflow` property

- Acceptable values: booleans
- Can be set by clients: no

A value of true indicates that the server reflows the entire terminal document when the viewport width (i.e., the value of the `term.viewport-width` property) changes.

A value of false indicates that the server MAY, after a viewport width change, continue to display unchanged parts of the terminal document according to the old viewport width.

### 2.7. The `term.output-wordwrap` property

- Acceptable values: booleans
- Can be set by clients: no

The value of this property indicates whether, when rendering the terminal document onto the terminal viewport, the server tries to prevent breaking lines inside words.
